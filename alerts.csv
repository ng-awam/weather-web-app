At elevated ozone levels, children, healthy\nadults who exert themselves, and individuals suffering from\nrespiratory disease such as asthma, bronchitis, or COPD can\nexperience reduced lung function and irritation. When this happens,\nindividuals may notice a shortness of breath, coughing, throat\nirritation, and/or experience an uncomfortable sensation to their\nchest. In addition, particulate pollution levels are expected to be\nmoderate for the same area. Although temperatures will not reach the\nHeat Alert levels, it will be warm so it is important to remember\nthat even in areas with moderate ozone and particulate pollution the\nhealth impacts will be compounded by the effects of the heat and\nhumidity.', 'The Maine Department of Environmental Protection recommends that\nindividuals consider limiting strenuous outdoor physical activity to\nreduce the risk of adverse health effects. People who may be\nespecially sensitive to the effects of elevated levels of pollutants\ninclude the very young, the elderly and those with pre-existing\nrespiratory problems such as asthma and or heart disease. Those with\nsymptoms should consider consulting their personal physician.', 'A toll free air quality hotline has been established so Maine\nresidents can stay informed on the air quality situations. The toll\nfree number is: 1-800-223-1196.', 'Additionally the Maine Department of Environmental Protection has\nthe air quality forecast available on the web at\nwww.maine.gov/dep/air/aqforecast.']"
